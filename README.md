# Numerical quantum physics ESPCI
two numerical projects for the quantum physics practical work at ESPCI.

## Preparatory work
**subject** :

we propose to find approximate numerical solutions to the problem of the quantum harmonic oscillator and to compare them with the analytical solutions demonstrated in class. For this we will consider the approach proposed by F.Marsiglio [1] in which the harmonic potential is localized inside an infinite potential and is thus truncated by the walls of the well. The eigenfunctions of the infinite well will then serve as the basis of the state space which will allow us to numerically search for the eigenenergies and approximate eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator.
